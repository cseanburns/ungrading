## INTRODUCTION

In order to foster good instruction and learning,
it is important to reflect on and question our
basic assumptions and practices.
Grading is one of the practices, and
there is increased, recent interest among faculty
at all levels of education
to reflect and question the need for this practice [@EQS6XZQN#blum20].
This recent attention has led to perhaps more faculty to move
away from grading and toward a multitude of approaches
that are broadly referred to as *ungrading*.
My goal with this paper is to provide a brief
historical overview of grading,
highlight some of the issues raised with grading,
especially its impact on learning and on inclusiveness,
and discuss some of the approaches to ungrading
that have been developed and adopted by faculty.
In my talk, I will also address some of what
I have learned using ungrading practices
in five distinct undergraduate and graduate
courses in two programs.

## BRIEF HISTORY OF GRADING

According to @X7FMWY26#durm93,
assigning grades to student work,
at least in the U.S.,
began in the late 18th century,
and may have been motivated by
a desire to standardize and classify student evaluations.
Various systems were first adopted by
the Ivy Leagues in the late 19th century.
These systems encompassed
percentage, point, and letter-based classifications, and
were the first to mark students as having
passed, failed, or somewhere in between.
In 1897, Mount Holyoke appears to be the first college to apply
the letter grade scheme that many of us use today.
However, this type of scheme
did not receive widespread attention until the 1940s and
a large proportion of primary, secondary schools, and colleges
had not adopted this system until 
the 1970s or '80s [@UL7J82EI#schinske14].

## APPARENT PURPOSE OF GRADING

Although the explicit purpose of grading is to provide
feedback to students about their scholastic achievement,
there are other systemic reasons that support the status quo.
That is, although adopting grading schemes may have been driven
by a desire to establish a systematic, reliable method of evaluation,
grading standards were also meant to establish
a standardized communication system of
evaluation between and among colleges and universities.
@UL7J82EI#schinske14 note that
grading may have pedagogical origins and motivations,
but it has largely taken
on organizational and bureaucratic purposes.

## CONCERNS WITH GRADING

Of particular concern with grading,
especially with *norm-referenced* grading schemes
(i.e., grading on a curve),
is that it encourages a belief that grades ought to
be normally distributed based on the natural aptitude of students. 
These grading schemes thus attempt
to measure inherent ability
rather than learning.
However, these assumptions and practices are problematic, and
it has long been shown that effective teaching
and better learning strategies
can result in better learning outcomes
for all students,
regardless of their natural abilities.
In short, it is the responsibility of the instructor to 
adopt effective, multiple instructional strategies
for the learners in a classroom [@4GJMLV6J#bloom68].

Grading schemes also encourage
competitive classroom environments
and incentivize students to focus on grades over learning.
Cooperative-based learning environments,
rather than competitive or individualistic-based ones,
lead to higher achievement, better retention,
increased ability to apply knowledge
and to problem solve [@BJIWNH53#johnson85].
Therefore, an ungrading approach
that provides thorough and qualitative feedback,
and explicit, well designed goals [@66L8W643#koehler22],
is more congruent in cooperative environments.

Furthermore, grades may not effectively
produce the desired outcome:
that is, to foster learning.
This is especially true when
compared to other types of feedback
that emphasize qualitative comments on student work.
@R4NRKHU6#butler86 showed that when students receive grades,
they tend to ignore comments,
and that students who receive comments alone
tend to outperform students who receive grades or
students who receive no feedback.
The results have been corroborated
more recently in other domains [@USJ29FES#bullock21].
Qualitative feedback may also reduce instructional bias,
which is believed to cause grading disparity between
under represented minorities (URM) and non-URM [@9JN4YE2D#low19].

## UNGRADING APPROACHES

Ungrading is an umbrella term
for multiple approaches to decenter grades and
to center learning through qualitative feedback
and increased student participation
in their own assessments.
One problem with ungrading is that 
instructors are still required to submit
grades to their registrars at
the end of a term or semester.
Working within such systems has meant
that various faculty have devised strategies
for providing final grades.
For example, @I9MMLPE9#stommel20 uses 
directed and open student self-evaluation methods
and process letters
that require students to reflect on their work,
and then asks students to provide their own final grade
based on those reflections and their work.
Peer-evaluation and self-evaluation,
especially guided through rubrics or predefined questions,
can also build meta-cognitive skills and
offer tools for self-correction [@UL7J82EI#schinske14].
@KJHKMCAT#gibbs20 uses an "all-feedback-no-grades" approach.
They write that they "call my approach
*all-feedback-no-grades*,
which is to say that I put no grades
on student work;
instead, I give my students feedback,
lots of feedback" (p. 92).
@9H6ZRVYF#katopodis20 start each term with a contract
that outlines the work involved to reach a 
specific grade at the end of the semester.
In this scenario,
students decide how
much work they want
to accomplish for the semester
to meet the conditions for a
specific letter grade.

## CONCLUSION

The primary responsibility of the instructor
is to foster student learning.
Whether grading or ungrading,
it is important to reflect on our practices
and whether those practices match our responsibility.
In this paper, I have presented several
types of ungrading practices
that faculty have already adopted.
The central argument is that grades
may detract from learning.
In my own courses, I have adopted the approach used by @KJHKMCAT#gibbs20,
the *all-feedback-no-grades* approach,
but with some differences that are largely dictated
by the type of course and by student level.
In my experience, this has led to increased
interaction and discussions with students.
